# webexplorer

This website is a personal project. It's build for previewing files, especially when you get some files and you don't have any applications to open it. If you want more functionalities or better user experience, you should use specific application.

Since it's not fully tested, it might have problems when opening some files, especially when the file is huge.

In theory, it can be improved to support more functionalities, there's no plan or enough resources yet. If you find any problems, you can create an issue at [here](https://github.com/exploreronweb/webexplorer/issues/new), there's no guarantee that it will be fixed immediately though.

Once this website is fully loaded, it should be able to work offline if you don't reinstall your browser or clear your browser storage.
